As more entrants begin to take a stake in wireless spectrum, there has been an uptick in issues between these  entrants and incumbents has been created. These issues go unnoticed by the public due to their technical nature, but can have sweeping affects on everyday systems that we take for granted. Additionally, as an individual constituent, it can difficult to stay educated about these topics. Available materials in this space can range in quality significantly; from being jargon filled, reliable and straight from the source, or even skewed research and misinformation.


Under the guidance of our professor Whitney Lohmeyer and SpectrumX (NSF), our class took on a plethora of these incumbent vs entrant coexistence issues. To begin we dove into the application of spectrum communications theory with the interference geometry of each issue. Each team then went on to explore FCC regulations, meeting notes, and other documentation on their issues, met with subject matter experts that shared interests with each issue, and ultimately concluded our work presenting to the SpectrumX & the NSF.
