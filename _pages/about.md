Hello, my name is Alex

I am first year computer science PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in Evanston, Il. after finishing my bachelors degree in electrical & computer engineering from [Olin College](https://www.olin.edu).

For the past three years, I have interned at IBM on the IBM Z mainframes as a part of the Millicode and System Architecture teams.

My research interests include hardware accelerators, hardware/software co-design, parallel computing, and functional programing.
