Hello, my name is Alex

I am first year computer science PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in Evanston, Il. after finishing my bachelors degree in electrical & computer engineering from [Olin College](https://www.olin.edu).

For the past three years, I have interned at IBM on the IBM Z mainframes as a part of the Millicode and System Architecture teams.

My research interests include hardware accelerators, hardware/software co-design, parallel computing, and functional programing.

#write your biography here. tell the world about yourself. link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). you can put a picture in, too. the code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
#
#put your address / p.o. box / other info right below your picture. you can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the yaml header of your `_pages/about.md`. edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
#
#link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
